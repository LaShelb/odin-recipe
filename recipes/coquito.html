    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Coquito is a creamy, tropical, Puerto Rican holiday drink with tons of coconut flavor. It's made with both evaporated and condensed milk, cream of coconut, spices, rum, and — in this version — egg yolks.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is always requested at my holiday gatherings. Sometimes I hide it in the fridge to keep for myself! Serve in glass cups and sprinkle with more cinnamon if desired. Feliz Navidad!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Evaporated milk: </strong> This coquito recipe starts with a can of evaporated milk.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs: </strong>Two beaten egg yolks contribute to the rich, thick, and creamy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream of coconut: </strong>Canned cream of coconut lends richness and gives the coquito its signature coconut flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Sweetened condensed milk: </strong>Sweetened condensed milk makes everything more delicious, including this coquito recipe!</li>
        <li><strong>White rum: </strong>The best rum for coquito is white Puerto Rican rum, such as Bacardi. In a pinch, any pleasant-tasting white rum will do.</li>
        <li><strong>Water: </strong>Water thins the thick and creamy mixture, making it super pourable.</li>
        <li><strong>Vanilla: </strong>A teaspoon of vanilla extract takes the flavor up a notch.</li>
        <li><strong>Spices: </strong>Cinnamon and cloves add warmth and coziness.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the evaporated milk and egg yolks in a double boiler until thick.</li>
        <li>Transfer the mixture to a blender and blend with the remaining ingredients.</li>
        <li>Transfer to glass bottles and refrigerator until cold.</li>
    </ol>
